AutoMounter is a professional-grade macOS utility that takes the hassle out of managing external drives and network storage. By automatically mounting volumes upon system startup or device connection, it ensures that your essential drives are always available without any manual intervention. This is especially useful for users who regularly work with multiple storage devices or access network-attached storage (NAS) for their daily tasks.

The application is built with a focus on reliability and system integration. It supports all common file systems and network protocols, including APFS, HFS+, exFAT, NTFS, SMB, and AFP. AutoMounter operates discreetly from the menu bar, providing quick access to settings and volume status while consuming minimal system resources. It is fully compatible with the latest macOS versions and optimized for both Intel and Apple Silicon architectures.

AutoMounter is ideal for photographers, video editors, IT administrators, and anyone who depends on quick access to external storage. It reduces workflow interruptions and helps maintain productivity by handling the mounting process automatically. With its straightforward setup and intuitive interface, AutoMounter is an essential tool for streamlining storage management on your Mac.
